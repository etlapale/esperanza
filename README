                           Esperanza µ-kernel

  Welcome to the new version of the Esperanza project.
  Esperanza will one day be an operating system based on a small µ-kernel.


  *Requirements*

    A standard compilation suite (gcc, binutils, make, a shell, ...).
    Python interpreter for some utility scripts.
    Genext2fs or Mtools to create virtual disks.
    Bochs or Qemu if you want to make a simulation.
    GRUB to load the system.
    An IA32 or AMD64 cpu to do real tests.


  *Quick test*

    If you want to build and try the kernel quickly, you can just type:

        make test


  *Configuration*

    The first step is to configure the kernel (and system) you want to
  build. You do this with one of the configuration script. For now, there
  is only one configuration script, configure.py, a ncurses based Python
  script. To do this simply type :

       	make menuconfig
  
    After that, a `config.h' file is generated and you can simply use make
  to build the system :

        make


  *Try*

    A simple `make test' should work.

    You need to use GRUB (or any multiboot compliant boot loader) to load
  the kicker which will find the kernel module and load it. As an example,
  here is a simple GRUB config:

        title=Esperanza

	root (hd0,0)
       	kernel /esperanza/kicker/kicker
       	module /esperanza/kernel/kernel
	module /esperanza/console/console


  *Learn*

    You can find more info of course in the sources, but also on the
  Esperanza website at http://esperanza.next-touch.com
  

  *Contribute*

    Your help is really welcome :) If you want to contribute to the project
  for example by develop new components, port it to another architecture or
  translate the documentation, contact us at esperanza@next-touch.com and/or
  consult the TODO file in the main directory.
